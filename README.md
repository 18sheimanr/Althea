# Althea - Digital Healthcare Assistant POC

Althea is a fully AI-driven assistant designed to streamline healthcare navigation. 

## Features

1. **Data Ingress**: Althea uses Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured data from unstructured inputs and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.

2. **Chain-of-Thought LLM**: This feature enables Althea to ask questions until healthcare navigation tasks are fully defined.

3. **Task Scheduler (WIP)**: The task scheduler identifies automatable tasks to complete. For example, "Email Dr. Smith about transferring medical records."

## Usage

Please reuse this code/framework for non-healthcare tasks.
